# Project Euler

All working solutions of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems (mostly done in python)

## Python

Usage: python3 [.py file]
Common files: function_collection python package (main.py)
Requirements.txt needs to be added in the future for any non-default dependency.

## C++

Use run_cpp.sh to run the .cpp source files
Usage: bash ./run_cpp.sh [.cpp file]
The temporary executable is removed after it is run. Might need optimization in the future.

## Haskell

In general, load with ghci (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), and use relevant function (no input, usually using 'calc').

## Highlights

- Poker hands calculations: 54.py -> python problems/54.py
- Sudoku solver: 96.py -> python problems/96.py
- Simple prime cpp: 03.cpp -> bash ./run_cpp.sh problems/03.cpp
