# Project Euler
All working solutions of Project Euler problems (mostly done in python)

https://projecteuler.net/

## Python
Usage: python3 [.py file]
Common files: function_collection python package (main.py)
Requirements.txt needs to be added in the future for any non-default dependency.

## C++
Use run_cpp.sh to run the .cpp source files
Usage: bash ./run_cpp.sh [.cpp file]
The temporary executable is removed after it is run. Might need optimization in the future.

## Haskell
In general, load with ghci (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), and use relevant function (no input, usually using 'calc').

# Highlights:
- Sudoku solver: 96.py -> python 96.py
- Simple prime cpp: 03.cpp -> bash ./run_cpp.sh 03.cpp
